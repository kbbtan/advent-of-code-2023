## Star 1

For Star 1, we can perform the HASH algorithm as defined on each sequence provided to obtain our answer.

## Star 2
 
For Star 2, we can also perform the sequence of steps as defined to obtain our answer, and the difficulty mostly lies in reading the (very long) prompt correctly. The problem serves as a nice introduction to hashmaps and how hashing works.
