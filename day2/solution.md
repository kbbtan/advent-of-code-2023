# Day 2: Cube Conundrum

## Star 1

The solution can be obtained by following the steps as described in the problem. Process each line to determine the number of each color of cubes that were shown at a given time. If the number of cubes shown are more than what we know is loaded into the bag, we know that the given game is impossible.

## Star 2

For Star 2, we can use similar logic to loop through each game and identify the numbers of cubes shown at any given time, but we instead keep track of the minimum number of cubes we would need. Then, we can calculate the power of these cubes and take their sum total as described in the question.
